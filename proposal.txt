We will be working on the To Do List project.

• It will include the ability to add, remove and mark as completed
• The user will be able to filter search for a particular ToDo Item.
• The user will be able to edit existing To Do items.
• The user will be able to set a priority of Important to any existing or new To Do Item.

Badges in Bootstrap - potentially for use as priority labels


Right now, each time a task is added to the list, todoArray is updated in parallel.
There should be a way to update the array and then update the display of tasks based on the array contents...
No idea how to do that right now, but it would make the code more dry, and give us access to taskItem information after the task is displayed.
